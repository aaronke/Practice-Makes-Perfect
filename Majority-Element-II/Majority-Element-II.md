# [Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/)

## Description
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times. The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

## Analysis
**Method 1 -- HashTable**  
Firstly, get the hashtable represenation of the array. And then if the key's value(frequencey) is larger than the limit and not shown in existing results.Then add it into result list.

* Time Complexity: `O(n)`
* Space Complexity: `O(n)`

**Method 2 -- Sorting**
Sort the number list firstly, and then if there is a interval that contains the same value but whose length is larger than the limit, then add it into results. 

* Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`
* Space Complexity: `O(1)`

**Method 3 -- To be updated -- Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm**

* Time Complexity: `O(n)`
* Space Complexity: `O(1)`
