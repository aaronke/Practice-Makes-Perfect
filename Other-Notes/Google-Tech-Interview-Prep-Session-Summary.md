*Google Tech Interview Prep Session Summary* 
--------
Here are some notes from Google Tech Interview Prep Session at UVa.

### Facts
1. 45 minutes interview
2. Depending on your performance, 1 ~ 3 questions may be asked.
3. White board or Google docs, no cheat sheet.


### General Take Home Ideas:
1. Think interview as a back-and-forth discussion, but not question-and-answer session. Therefore, alway make sure Interviewer is on the same page with you. In another word, please think loud and over-communicate is better than no communication.

2. Interviewer cares how candidate analyzes problem. how quickly condidate learn and  how effectively condidate communicate with others. Specifically, when it comes to algorithm issues, they would see if interviewees divide the problem in a logical way or if they set properate prioritier when facing multiple sub-problems. During the process, they would also consider about whether you are person pleasant to work with.

3. Don't be frustrated, "bombed" an interview but still can get hired. You might not finish the question, but it's fine also.

4. Finally remember that Interviewers are trying to hire you! So don't heasitate to ask for help! 

### Interview Content
**Fundametnals** -- Algorithms and data structures  
**Important data structures** --  hashtable, linked list, array, tree, queue, stack 


### Specific  Suggestions
1. Practice on whieteboard or google doc (Use *Courier New* Font) and write actual code. To save your time on google doc, you can use copy and paste.

3. Don't go ahead to do coding. Clarify question first. For example, you can start with picking a simple example and then manually go through it, which will make sure you understand the issue correctly. And usually it's hard to get the answer instantly and so you can say `OK,  let me think for seconds!`.

4. Don't assume brute-force is unacceptable. No matter how easy it is, introducing brute-force solution firstly will be good! 

5. Think the right data structures and it will save you tons of time in implementation!

6. Your code should be readable and maintable. Don't use variable name like "mytable". Instead, use meaningful names!

7. After finishing your coding, please write as many as edge cases you can and manully go through some of them on your code. Generally, test cases you write down should contain input and expected outputs. Since all the test cases are automatically provided and hidden in Leetcode, remember to do them by yourself when practicing.

8. Don't be nervous if you have syntax error. 90% of Interviewer would be tolerant about small syntaxs.

9. In order to evaluate yourself, you could also record yourself and evaluate whether you follow the suggestions above and explain clearly.


## Question Asked by Interviewer

1. Interviewer may ask you, `Can you do better?`. No matter it is yes or not, explain why! 
2. You may also be asked `Is that your final answer`. Instead of directly saying No, You could run through examples and test your code!! It's better to catch issues by yourself.
3. After completing the first issue in the first level, Interviewer may ask deeper questions, such as `Can you implement this recursively?`, `How can we get the number of total paths, instead of just the shortest one`, `How big graph?` or `How much memory would it use`. 


## Sample Question
Imagine you have word A and word B, please find the shortest steps to convert A to B and then return the path of those steps.
